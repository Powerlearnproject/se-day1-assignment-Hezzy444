#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, tools, to develop and maintain software systems involving product designs, product development, -product testing and deployment as well as maintenance.Software Engineering plays an important role in the Tech. industry as it enables the creation of reliable, scalabale and innovative software solutions that meets user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Software Engineering milestones started with the development of programming languages (Fortran, C, C+,C++, etc) in the 1940s-1950
-It became established as a discipline in the 1960s
-The advent of structured programming started in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
- Design: Creating high-level detailed designs
- Implementation: Writing codes and building software according to specification
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure quality standards and functional requirements
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers
- Maintenance: Providing on-going supports, updates, etc.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downward like a waterfal (e.g: Requirement, Design, Implementation) While the Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and response to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: writing codes and implementating software solutions
- Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project Manager: oversees planning, execution & delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs: these are software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging & testing codes (e.g: visual studios, eclipse, intelliJ IDEA)
- VCS: these are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g: Git, Subversion) 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges faced by software engineers include:
- Changing requirements
- Tight deadlines
- Technical debt
Strategies to overcome these challenges include:
- Effective communication
- Agile methodologies
- Task prioritization
- Regular reassessment of project goals & timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit: testing individual components or modules of software
- Integration: testing interactions between different components and subsystems
- System: testing the entire software system as a whole
- Acceptance: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
They are important in software quality assurance by helping to identify & fix defects early in the development process, leading to high-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is about asking the right questions or giving the right instructions to your AI robot. It is like creating a special recipe for your AI. It is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your bot or AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Tell me about history (vague)
- Tell me the history of ancient Ghana (Improved prompt):This is clearer, more specific and concise & hence, more effective to get the desired answer from the bot.
